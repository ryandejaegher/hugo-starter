Reducing friction is important when it comes to writing and publishing. I don't think it's impossible to develop the habit of writing and taking notes but it does require eliminating friction anywhere you encounter it. This is one of my first notes where I'm experimenting with a different approach  


### My first writing approach
- WordPress

When I first started getting into web development WordPress was just beginning it's big transition to Gutenberg. Gutenberg was a big shift from writing in the classic editor. 

Gutenberg cons
- Clunky editing experience
- Slow loading
- Unclear on how to import content into Gutenberg
	- This could have probably been figured out 

### My second writing workflow
1. Roam Research
2. Obsidian
3. Forestry

### My current writing experiment
1. Roam Research
2. Obsidian

Roam Research is where the mess takes place. 

### Why Obsidian and Roam

Benefits of Obsidian
- Markdown
- Local File (don't need to worry about internet)
- Ability to add folders/vaults
- Ability to preview live site locally
- Content is portable, you can easily take the content over to a new site or new platform without having to do an export
- It's easier to update and make changes. Just go to the file, make the changes and save

With Obsidian I can add

What are some common things that get in the way of writing?



### Being online
- If you're only able to write/publish when you're online that's a pain

### Formatting and Metadata
- Think of the difference between writing a tweet or writing a blog post
	- A Tweet
		- A tweet is limited to 280 characters
		- A tweet doesn't require a title. Arguably though the opening line is the **headline**
		- No need to share it/promote it, the tweet is already in the feed
	- A blog post
		- Requires a **good headline** *(but please no clickbait)*
		- Requires a slug/url
		- Social share image (not required, but shared image results can vary based on the site)
		- Requires an excerpt
		- No constraints on word count which can be a curse or a blessing
