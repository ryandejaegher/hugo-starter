Recently there was a question in Squarespace forums about how to style a navigation link to look like a button. 

Today I'm going to show you how to do this with custom CSS and also share some of the do's and don't's when implementing this feature. First let's look at the purpose for this kind of design. 

## Why Make Your Link Look Like a Button?

Sometimes you have a specific action you want visitors to take and you want to highlight this action in your navigation. This is a very common design pattern you'll see across websites. You can see an example of this on the Squarespace homepage. Notice the **Get Started** button on the far right.

By making the link look like a button it makes it stand out amongst the other elements in the navigation. The size and different color quickly draws peoples attention to it. 

How do you do this?

* 1. Add a link to your navigation
  * 1. This can be an existing page, an external link, or folder

What makes the link look like a button? Background color and padding. 

* Some considerations
* Don't add this to the button in the middle of links
  * i.e. Link Link **Button** Link Link

Rules of Thumb

You shouldn't have any more than 2 button style links. What makes this design work is that the one button stands out amongst the other links. If you have multiple button links it dilutes the strength of the effect. 

If you want to have two button links, it's important to not make them the exact same. One button should be the **primary button,** and the other should be the **secondary buton.** 

You'll often see this design pattern for web apps/tools that encouraging visitors to sign u p, but they also want to make it easy for existing users to login.
