Looking for an easy way to add a fixed vertical navigation to your Squarespace site? Today I'm going to share a little script with you that you can use to easily add a vertical navigation to your entire site or to individual pages.

### Installation Instructions

### Benefits

Get an additional menu without interfering with the default menu

### How does it work?

Add <vertical-nav> and then add your links in between

Set the **_side_** to specify which side the menu will remain on

### Add Site Wide

Add this code to Settings -> Advanced -> Code Injection -> Footer

### Add To Individual Pages

You'll need to insert a code block into the page where you'd like to add the vertical-nav. ((does this work with page settings?))

### Mix Site Wide + Individual Pages

### Compatibility/Requirements

* Squarespace 7.0/7.1
* Requires Business Plan

### Notes

Limit it to 4-6 links

Menu will be hidden on mobile, the reason is that there isn't enough room on mobile to ensure that it doesn't overlap the main content.
