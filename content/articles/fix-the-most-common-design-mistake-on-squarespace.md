There is a very common issue I see on Squarespace sites, and once I point it out you'll have a hard time unseeing it. I'm talking about wiiiiiiiiiiiide text blocks. Today I'm going to tell you why this is a problem and how you can fix it. 

### Why is this is a problem?

Have you ever had the experience while reading where you felt like you were losing your place? Or that you unintentionally read the same line twice or had trouble finding the next line.

This can be attributed to bad line-length.

Commonly on Squarespace I'll see designers where the text covers the entire width of the screen. 

My suspicion is that people are trying to remove spacing on the sides of the site to have **full width sections** **for images**. 

The problem is that this affects the text on the page as well. 

### Why should you care about line-length? 

1. Make it easier for people to read (which increases the chances people will read)
2. It's a common mistake I've seen on DIY sites. If you're trying to set your design apart from an amateur this is helpful. 

### What's the ideal line-length?

This changes based on the font size.

On mobile, the line-length is determined by the screen width so it's less of an issue there. 

However on desktop is where you need to watch out for it.
