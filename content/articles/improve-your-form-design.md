Outline: 

Why horizontal forms are bad

* To understand why horizontal forms aren't great it helps to have an understanding of line-length (read more about that here)

When horizontal forms work

* You have a single input (i.e. an email address)

What to use instead: vertical forms

Why are so many forms bad?

* In an effort to create "clean and minimal" forms people unintentionally create bad forms. 

Bad form practice

* Really wide forms
* Forms that are too narrow
* Hiding labels and only using placeholders
*
