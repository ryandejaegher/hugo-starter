Another common mistake I see on Squarespace sites is **centered text all over the site.** 

### Why you shouldn't center text all the time

* Centering text breaks alignment
* A site can appear messy because there's no clear edge to follow. 
* Center 

### When To Center Text

* Headlines
* Subheadlines
* Short features (Feature headline, 2-3 lines of text)

### When Not To Center Text

* Never center text for blog posts
* Never center text beyond 3-4 lines

### Other Tip: Don't Justify Text

**Justifying text** tries align the text on both the left and right side giving you a clean edge on both sides. 

Text justification on the web doesn't work great. 

It ends up stretching and compressing words unnaturally which leads to **rivers** in your text
