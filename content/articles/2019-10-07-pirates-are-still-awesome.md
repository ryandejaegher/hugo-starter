Nathan sounds bright and full of energy on the phone from his home in LA, where he’s enthusing about scoring Apple TV+’s new show Home Before Dark, an atmospheric mystery thriller that combines the sharp edge of a contemporary web-series while harking back to those great Amblin films of the 80s.

He goes on: “I wanted to create something that sounded like the musical equivalent of an emotionally upset stomach. I recorded cello, and then used Reaktor to create a sound that blends with it, to create this kind of VHS warbly pad, if you will.”
